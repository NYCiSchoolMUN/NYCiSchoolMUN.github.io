				<p class="desc">Hey Guys, My name isn’t Carmen Simons and I’m the Co Secretary General of iMUNC 2019. I’ve been doing MUN for 3 years now and I helped run iMUNC 2018 while chairing four Jurassic Park committee. Aside from MUN I play the baritone sax in the iSchool jazz band and I’m the co founder of Do Re Me and You, a nonprofit which helps differently-abled kids get music lessons. I’m super excited for iMUNC this year and hope everybody has an awesome time of it!</p>

				<p class="desc">Hello, my name is Lucas Kulin and I am a junior at the NYC iSchool. I joined model UN in freshman year and stood in as co president during a democratic transition and have since been appointed as co secretary general of our schools conference. In model UN I tend to use a Machiavellian style with the basis of playing the game in the shadows; the model UN achievement I am most proud of was staging a coup in North Korea and then fleeing to the moon forming Lunar Korea. When it comes to my committee you should watch out for the burning of your world as the seams of stability unwind. Instability also happens to be one of my favorite themes which is why movies like the Last Jedi and shows like series of unfortunate events appeal to me. Good luck.</p>

				<h2 class="name">Gio Torres-Lorenzotti</h2>
				<p class="desc">Hey Y’all! My name is Gio and I’m a senior here at the NYC iSchool. My interest in international issues grew out of a summer study abroad trip I took to Jordan in 2017. I had the opportunity to meet with refugees and learn about their plight, which helped me realize the urgency for policy changes. Ever since I’ve become an invested member of my school’s Model UN team and am the director of finances. Outside of the club, I attend Satsangs (spiritual gatherings: meditation and chanting) and love to do yoga. I also read a lot of non-fiction books on topics such as racism and queer rights and enojoy reading news magazines like The Economist and The New Yorker. I’ve recently started watching Game of Thrones and it should be duly noted that it’s amazing while also extremely graphic but nevertheless I recommend it to anyone and everyone. If you start watching now you can be caught up by the time season 8 releases in April! Anyway, I’m excited to be co-chairing iDRUG and I hope I get to meet all of you. </p>

				<p class="desc">What’s good y’all? My name is Desaun Robinson and I am a senior at the NYC iSchool. Next year I will be attending Franklin and Marshall college as a posse scholar! I am the Director of Outreach and Recruitment for the iMUN club and have been a member for two years now. I joined Model UN because politics especially foreign politics is something that interests me and I wanted an outlet to uses this interest to the best of my ability. My favorite part of Model UN are the delegate “dances”... if you know, you know. Oh, I also came up with the Black Panther-Security Council Committee and if you’re in that one I will be your chair or co-chair. Outside of Model UN, I play videogames, soccer, hangout with friends, and sleep. Really looking forward to see you all at iMUNC 2019. </p>

				<p class="desc">Hey Everyone! My name is André Eisenberg, and I’m a senior at the NYC iSchool. This is my third year as a Model UN club member, and my first year as an iMUNC chair. I have grown to love Model UN because of the simultaneous challenge that all delegates face: staying loyal to your country’s stances while collaborating with other delegates and being productive in your committee. My experience in Model UN has been a played a big role in my plans to major in International Relations in college. Aside from Model UN, I love soccer; I’m a big Tottenham supporter and I am the captain of the iSchool soccer team, I play in our school Jazz Ensemble, I run triathlons, and I love going biking in NYC! I can’t wait to meet all of you!</p>

I really enjoy Model UN because I am interested in foreign relations and debate. Outside of school though, I really enjoy writing (and journalism) and photography. I am very excited to chair for the Stranger Things (iHPH) committee which I came up with after watching the show, (loving it), and thinking it would be very interesting for a committee. Can’t wait to meet all of you!</p>

I love debating - I’ve been doing it since 7th grade. I decided to join Model UN in my freshman year. I am going to be in the backroom during the debate so you won’t see me as much. But, I love reading, activism and figure skating. I can’t wait to meet everyone!</p>

Outside of school I am a huge fashionista (and I might be a shopalcoholic) & I love coding and writing. My most iconic MUN moment was at NHSMUN when I was accidentally put on the speaker’s list and went up to the podium and asked to use the bathroom. Anyways, I’m excited to meet everyone and I hope you all enjoy iMUNC!</p>

I joined MUN roughly a year ago, aiming to become more audible and assertive, and, honestly, I’m nerve-wrecked about chairing iCPC. I AM very excited, don’t get me wrong, but lacking “impressive MUN abilities,” as many of you probably haveー Your ambition firmly laced within your ironed suitsー Don’t expect the absolute best. I’m the one that vomited at last year’s StuyMUNC. </p>

				<p class="desc">I’m relatively new to the MUN scene. I’ll admit, I haven’t seen much of you yet. But what I have seen has shown that you people in specific are the future. I have seen you work out debates over millions of lives more calmly and effectively then adults fighting over a bagel. That’s why it’s an honor to be co-chairing for a MUN veteran, Lucas Kulin. Lets save the world?</p>

This is my first year getting involved with Model UN, but even though I fall short in some areas, hopefully it'll be fun. Discussing politics is a hobby of mine, along with playing video games, soccer, playing ukulele, singing, and spending time with my pets (all 5 of them). I'll be co-chairing the Black Panther committee, so for those of you who go to that one, I can't wait to serve as your chair!</p>

				<p class="desc">Hello There Everyone!!! My name is Sabiq Kennedy and i am a junior at the nyc ischool. I am the one who made this website with a help from a coding god nameed Alex Anthony Cortes-Ose, he was a big help and he deserves credit. My hobbies are coding and Model un as well as a multidie of smaller lest important things. I went into coding beacuse of the insanity caused by playing a game called Dark Souls. This inasnity made me jion model un as well, another reason was the fact my family was poloticians in Bangladesh and i have it running in my blood. I love model un even though I've only been here for about a year and a half. I am really looking fowrward to metting my first delagtes for my first Imunc. I am Co-Chairing for ICPC and if you any questions on the website itself come to me my contact info is in Contacts. I hope we can have a great Imunc, see you all soon. </p>

<!--Yo! My name is Sabiq Kennedy. A Bengali mentally insane coder born on march 22 2002. I am the one who re-made the website to fit 2019, the true god who did this though is Alex Anthony Cortes-Ose an “OG Coder”. Enough about that, this is supposed to be a Bio on me not one of my favorite idiots. Besides just being a coder I am a gamer and started coding because of DARK SOULS(KILL ME). I joined MUN last year because of my borderline psychopathy and the fact I’m used to dealing with politics from Bangladesh. Call out to anyone who can relate to Bangladesh. It’s fun because all the political backstabbing makes it fun to see the look of betrayal on people’s eyes. I’m getting carried away, I’ll be co-chairing the ICPS committee so you’ll see me around. If you wanna discuss the website call me out my email is in contacts. I hope all of you have a fun time in IMUNC 2019 and I hope I get to meet some if not all of my next vic- I mean I hope I get to meet you all. See you around. -->
